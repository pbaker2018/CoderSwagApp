# CoderSwagApp

Android App using Kotlin and Android studio

On the homepage (the main activity) this app displays four categories of goods, and if you click on a category it will display a list of products within that category.

It was my first time using Recycler Views.

The span-count will differ if the device is a tablet or when the device is rotated landscape, so that the display is proportional to the screen width.

There is no testing included.
